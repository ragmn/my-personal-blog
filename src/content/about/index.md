I like exploring new places and experiencing the wonders of travel! So far, I've had the opportunity to explore and learn about 14 different countries & many states within India. It's been an amazing journey, discovering new cultures, meeting diverse people, and experiencing the beauty of our world.

<br/>
I enjoy practicing yoga and diving into spirituality & meditation during my free time. Yoga/meditation helps me find balance and stay centered, while exploring spirituality allows me to delve into the deeper aspects of life and gain a greater understanding of myself and the world around me.
