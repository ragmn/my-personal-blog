As a passionate hobby traveler and travel blogger, I had explored various destinations around the world, but the Himalayas had always been a dream for me. The towering peaks, serene landscapes, and the mystique surrounding these majestic mountains beckoned me to embark on a new adventure. Finally, the day came when I decided to take on the challenge of my first Himalayan hike â€“ the SAR Pass.

The journey began with meticulous planning, which included selecting the right organization to organize the trip. After thorough research and reading countless reviews, I chose "Himalaya Expeditions" as my host organization. They had a reputation for providing safe and well-organized treks, and their commitment to responsible tourism and supporting local communities aligned with my values.

Day 1: Arrival in Manali
I arrived in Manali, a beautiful town in Himachal Pradesh, which served as the starting point for our adventure. The Himalaya Expeditions team greeted us warmly at their hostel, the "Mountain Haven." The hostel exuded a cozy and rustic charm, and the friendly staff made us feel right at home. We had a pre-trek briefing, where we were introduced to our guide, Raj, who had an intimate knowledge of the terrain and shared insightful stories about the region.

Day 2: Manali to Kasol
We began our journey with a scenic drive from Manali to Kasol, a picturesque village nestled along the Parvati River. The drive itself was an adventure as we navigated winding mountain roads with breathtaking views. In Kasol, we checked into the "Parvati Woods Cottage," a quaint and comfortable accommodation provided by Himalaya Expeditions.

Day 3: Kasol to Grahan
Our hike officially started as we made our way from Kasol to the remote village of Grahan. The trail was challenging but incredibly rewarding. We passed through dense forests, crossed gushing streams, and encountered local shepherds and their livestock. Our guide Raj was a wealth of knowledge, sharing insights about the flora and fauna of the region. We stayed in a cozy homestay in Grahan, where we were treated to delicious Himachali cuisine.

Day 4: Grahan to Min Thach
The journey continued as we ascended higher into the mountains. The landscapes became more dramatic, with snow-capped peaks in the distance. We reached Min Thach, a high-altitude campsite, where Himalaya Expeditions had set up comfortable tents. The evening was spent around a bonfire, sharing stories with fellow trekkers and gazing at the star-studded Himalayan sky.

Day 5: Min Thach to SAR Pass Base Camp
The most challenging part of the trek awaited us as we climbed towards the SAR Pass Base Camp. The air grew thinner, and the temperature dropped, but the determination to conquer SAR Pass kept us going. We reached the base camp, where Himalaya Expeditions had prepared hot meals and provided us with warm sleeping bags to combat the cold.

Day 6: SAR Pass Summit and Biskeri Thach
The day we had all been waiting for had arrived. We started early to make our way to the summit of SAR Pass. The ascent was demanding, but as we stood at the top, gazing at the panoramic views of the Himalayas, it was all worth it. We descended to Biskeri Thach, another picturesque campsite, where we celebrated our achievement with a sense of accomplishment and gratitude.

Day 7: Biskeri Thach to Barshaini
Our descent continued as we made our way to Barshaini. The lush meadows, dense forests, and the gurgling Parvati River accompanied us on our journey. We arrived in Barshaini, where Himalaya Expeditions had arranged comfortable lodgings for our last night in the mountains.

Day 8: Return to Manali
As we bid farewell to the Himalayas, we felt a deep connection with the mountains and the people we had met along the way. The journey back to Manali was bittersweet, but the memories of our SAR Pass hike would stay with us forever.

My first Himalayan hike with Himalaya Expeditions was an unforgettable experience. Their dedication to safety, responsible tourism, and the well-being of their guests made the journey not only thrilling but also meaningful. As a travel blogger, I knew I had discovered a gem in the SAR Pass trek, and I couldn't wait to share this extraordinary adventure with my readers, hoping to inspire them to embark on their Himalayan journey someday.
