**Day 1: Exploring the Heart of Prague**

Welcome to the enchanting city of Prague! This city, often referred to as the "City of a Hundred Spires," is a treasure trove of history, culture, and stunning architecture. Let's dive right into a memorable 3-day adventure.

**Morning:**

Start your day with a hearty Czech breakfast at a local café. Savor some traditional dishes like chlebíčky (open-faced sandwiches) or palacinky (pancakes) while sipping on a cup of strong Czech coffee.

After breakfast, head to the iconic Prague Castle. This sprawling complex is not only the largest castle in the world but also offers some of the best panoramic views of the city. Don't miss the stunning St. Vitus Cathedral and the charming Golden Lane within the castle grounds.

**Lunch:**

For a delicious lunch, make your way to Malá Strana, the Lesser Town of Prague. Here, you'll find cozy restaurants serving classic Czech dishes like svíčková (marinated beef) or trdelník (sweet pastries). Enjoy your meal in the picturesque square while taking in the views of the Charles Bridge.

**Afternoon:**

Cross the iconic Charles Bridge, adorned with statues of saints, artists, and musicians. Wander through the winding cobblestone streets of the Old Town. Be sure to visit the famous Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Square.

**Evening:**

As the sun sets, find a cozy pub to try some of Prague's world-renowned beer. Czech beer is a true cultural experience, and you'll find plenty of options to choose from. Pair your beer with traditional Czech pub food like goulash or pork knuckle.

**Day 2: Discovering Prague's Hidden Gems**

**Morning:**

Start your day with a visit to the historic Jewish Quarter (Josefov). Explore the beautifully preserved synagogues and the Old Jewish Cemetery. The Spanish Synagogue, with its intricate Moorish architecture, is a highlight.

**Lunch:**

Head to a local bistro to sample a hearty bowl of traditional Czech soup, such as kulajda or bramborová (potato soup). These soups are both comforting and delicious.

**Afternoon:**

Spend your afternoon wandering through the charming district of Vyšehrad. This historical fort offers stunning views of the Vltava River and is a peaceful escape from the bustling city center. Explore the Vyšehrad Cemetery, the final resting place of many Czech luminaries.

**Evening:**

Enjoy dinner at one of the riverside restaurants in the Smíchov district. The view of Prague Castle illuminated at night is truly magical. Afterward, take a leisurely stroll along the Vltava River and capture the city's stunning night lights.

**Day 3: Road Trip to Český Krumlov with a Stop at Trosky State Castle**

**Morning:**

Today's road trip adventure will include a stop at the striking Trosky State Castle before heading to Český Krumlov. After a hearty breakfast in Prague, hit the road early to make the most of your day.

**Stop 1: Trosky State Castle**

Approximately halfway between Prague and Český Krumlov, you'll reach Trosky State Castle, a dramatic pair of castle ruins perched atop two basalt volcanic plugs. The journey to Trosky State Castle will take around 1.5 to 2 hours from Prague.

Upon arrival, you'll be greeted by the impressive sight of the two towers, named Baba and Panna, rising dramatically from the surrounding landscape. Explore the castle's ruins, climb to the top for panoramic views, and learn about its rich history. It's a fantastic spot for photography enthusiasts.

After your visit to Trosky State Castle, find a nearby restaurant to enjoy a leisurely lunch. Taste some Czech countryside specialties, such as roasted duck or venison, while taking in the serene rural atmosphere.

**Afternoon: Continue to Český Krumlov**

Resume your road trip to Český Krumlov, which is approximately a 2-hour drive from Trosky State Castle. The scenic drive through the Czech countryside is a treat in itself, with rolling hills, charming villages, and picturesque landscapes.

**Arrival in Český Krumlov:**

Upon arrival in Český Krumlov, check into your chosen accommodation and freshen up. You'll still have plenty of daylight left to explore this magical town.

**Evening:**

Begin your exploration of Český Krumlov's Old Town, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Stroll along the cobblestone streets, visit artisan shops, and admire the beautifully preserved medieval architecture. Don't forget to enjoy dinner at one of the local restaurants, where you can savor Czech cuisine while immersed in the town's enchanting ambiance.
