The saying "Spirituality begins where science ends" suggests that there are aspects of existence that transcend the physical and material realms. One way to connect with this spiritual dimension is through the practice of sandyavandane, which involves reverence for the natural elements.
The simple aspects of air, water, earth, sky, and ether can serve as powerful tools for spiritual growth:

- Air represents the breath and the vital life force.
- Water symbolizes the flow of emotions and the cleansing power of the divine.
- Earth represents stability, grounding, and the physical manifestation of the divine.
- The sky's vastness and ever-changing nature inspire a sense of wonder and connection to the cosmos.
- Ether, or akasha, is the subtle, pervasive element that underlies all creation.

By engaging with these natural elements through practices like sandyavandane, individuals can deepen their spiritual understanding and connection to the divine, recognizing the sacred within the physical world.

## Table of contents

## 1. Defination

The word "sandhya" means "twilight" in Sanskrit. "Vandanam" means "salutation" or "worship." So, sandhyavandanam literally means "salutation to the twilight." However, it is also used to refer to the prayers that are done during dawn and dusk.
Sandhya Vandanam is an ancient Hindu ritual performed by followers of vedic traditions. It holds immense spiritual significance and involves offering prayers and salutations to the divine during the transition periods of the day. This post aims to explore the essence of Sandhya Vandanam, its importance, and provide a simple meaning on the mantras chanted during this ritual.

The detailed aspects of Chaturvimshatimurti be found in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaturvimshatimurti" target="_blank">link🡕</a>. Furthermore, Kanaka Dasaru wrote a popular poem called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHGK-Dt-vNo&ab_channel=Daasoham" target="_blank">**Keshava nama🡕**</a> in Kannada that's considered a masterpiece. The poem beautifully & devotionally written around each of these twenty-four names.

> om āpo jvotī rasomrtam brahma bhūrbhuy

Continue reciting first part of the mantra and for the second and third part as mentioned above, exhale fully and take a deep breath to retain it. While holding the breath & covering nose with your right hand fingers, recite the remaining mantra in your mind, followed by a complete exhalation.

**Meaning:**

This passage explains that Parabrahma is the sage of the sacred syllable OM (Pranava), and Paramātmā is the supreme soul. The deity Gayatri is related to rhythm and is linked to seven great sages: Visvamitra, Jamadagni, Bharadvaja, Gautama, Atri, Vasishtha, and Kashyapa. Deities like Agni, Vayu, Aditya, Brihaspati, Varuna, and Indra are connected to Vyāhrtīs and various meters such as Gāyatrī, Uṣṇik, Anuṣṭup, Brhatī, Parkti, Tristup, and Jagatyah. The Gāyatrī mantra is associated with Prajapati and deities like Brahma, Agni, Vayu, and Aditya, as mentioned in the Yajurveda. Pranayama, or breath control, involves reciting the Gāyatrī mantra while holding one's breath and covering the nose with fingers.

### 2.3 Sankalpa

A sincere pledge to self prior to commencing the ritual. Sankalpa aligns the practitioner's actions with cosmic order by acknowledging one's presence in space and time according to Hindu calendar system.. This very beautifully explained by Bannanje Govindacharya in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSdrV20PbC4&ab_channel=SETHURAMSN" target="_blank">video interview 🡕</a> It helps establish dharmic framework and seek blessings for righteous conduct.

**Meaning:**

"Adyana" is the mantra. The sage is Shyavashva Atreya. The deity is Savita, and the meter is Gayatri. This is the invocation for the recitation of the Savitri Gayatri mantra. O Deva Savita, on this day, grant us auspiciousness and protect us from bad dreams. Illuminate all the worlds, O Deva Savitar, and remove all obstacles. May all that is fallen or without a mother be forgiven, O Lord Narayana, I bow to you.

In the middle of this practice, I will recite the three sacred names: Achyuta, Ananta, Govinda. I bow to Achyuta, Ananta, Govinda. I bow to Achyuta, Ananta, Govinda. May all impurities be washed away. I am not the doer; Hari is the true doer. This knowledge is always true. The worship of Hari is always recommended. The holy water is applied all over the body, and thus, the morning ritual is completed."

This isn't just a morning or evening thing; it's a daily reminder of how connected we are to the big cosmic picture. And in the midst of our busy lives, that reminder is truly invaluable.🌄💫
