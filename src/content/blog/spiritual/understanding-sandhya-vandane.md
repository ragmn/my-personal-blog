## 1. Defination

The word "sandhya" means "twilight" in Sanskrit. "Vandanam" means "salutation" or "worship." So, sandhyavandanam literally means "salutation to the twilight." However, it is also used to refer to the prayers that are done during dawn and dusk.
Sandhya Vandanam is an ancient Hindu ritual performed by followers of vedic traditions. It holds immense spiritual significance and involves offering prayers and salutations to the divine during the transition periods of the day. This post aims to explore the essence of Sandhya Vandanam, its importance, and provide a simple meaning on the mantras chanted during this ritual.
